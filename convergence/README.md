# Convergence scripts

This folder collects various scripts used to validate the convergence rate for
the different methods and operators implemented. Since assessing whether the
convergence rate is the expected one is a difficult task to automate, most
scripts in this folder will simply generate a figure showing the error as a
function of e.g. mesh size. These figures can then be used to visually assess
and decide whether the implementation seems correct.

> :warning: Some of these scripts may can take a few minutes to run.
